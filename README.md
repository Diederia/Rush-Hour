# Rush Hour solver
This is a rush hour solver written in python. It is tested using seven different begin configurations of the game with three different board sizes (6x6, 9x9 and 12x12). 

## Running the program
Running the code with command line in the terminal: python Boards/board.csv algorithm rushhour.py
* Possible algorithms: astar or bfs
* Possible boards: board1 till board7

Example if you would like to run the 5th board with an astar algorithm

```
python Boards/board5.csv astar rushhour.py
```
